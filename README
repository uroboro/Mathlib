Compilation of mathematical functions. Mostly matrix based ones. For now.

List:
- Allocate memory for a square matrix of any order
- Make an identity matrix
- Check matrix identity
- Check matrix simmetry
- Transpose a matrix
- Determinant of a matrix (Laplace's theorem)

- Get the solution to a system of n equations of n unknowns (Cramer's theorem, with Laplace's)
